# FaceMask_Detection
This project contains a local script named that using a cloud function and a model trained in the cloud, can take pictures and these are processed in the cloud in order to return if the face pic took has a facemask or not.
It works with a 100% of accuracy but actually fails when you the photo shooted contains somebody with a headset on.
