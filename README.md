# Face Mask Detection Project

This project is part of a university initiative at the **Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB)**. The objective is to develop and train an artificial intelligence (AI) model capable of detecting whether individuals in images are wearing face masks. The project makes extensive use of **Google Cloud** services for data storage, model training, and deployment.

## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to train an image detection model that identifies whether people in photographs or live video feeds are wearing face masks. The implementation is designed to aid in maintaining health and safety standards, especially in public spaces where mask mandates are in place.

## Technologies Used
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: For cloud-based storage, computing, and deployment.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: To build and train the machine learning model.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and real-time video analysis.
- **Python**: The core programming language used for development.
